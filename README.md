# AutoTax-API

🧠 Software Code Bio: Tax Withholding + Filing API System

📌 Project Name: autotax-api

📋 Purpose

This API is designed to automatically calculate, withhold, store, and file tax payments from crypto and fiat transactions based on the region determined from a user’s IP or MAC address. It streamlines compliance by saving taxes into separate wallets and enabling automatic or one-click tax filings, either as downloadable reports or through government e-filing integrations.

🏗️ Core Features

✅ 1. IP/MAC-Based Regional Tax Calculation

Uses IP geolocation services (e.g., ipapi) to detect the user’s country and state.

Falls back to MAC address when IP fails (e.g., offline kiosks or private networks).

Dynamically applies tax rate based on the region from tax-rates.json.


💸 2. Token-Agnostic Tax Withholding

Works with all fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) and cryptocurrencies (ETH, USDC, custom tokens).

Can be extended to support ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, or any EVM-compatible token.


🔐 3. Separate Tax Wallet Management

Simulates sending tax amount to a designated tax wallet.

Easily replaceable with smart contract or multisig wallet logic.


🧾 4. One-Click Filing System

Offers a /generate-tax-filing endpoint to generate:

Year-end tax summary JSON

PDF template (via EJS) showing tax amounts, region, currency


Can be extended to integrate directly with e-filing APIs (e.g., IRS, EU VAT, GST platforms)


🧩 5. Modular, Express-Based API Architecture

Built using Node.js with Express.js and modular JS utilities

Easy to plug into your U-Panel or admin dashboard

Customizable configuration for rates and blockchain tokens

🚀 How It Works (Workflow)

1. Transaction Occurs

User sends a payment (crypto or fiat) via your app or platform.



2. IP/MAC Detected

IP address sent to the API → region and country are resolved.

If IP fails, MAC address is used (optional in offline cases).



3. Tax Rate Resolved

System checks tax-rates.json for applicable percentage.



4. Withholding Executed

Calculates tax → sends tax amount to wallet → logs transaction.



5. Filing Triggered

At year-end, admin hits /generate-tax-filing endpoint.

JSON and PDF report is generated instantly.
